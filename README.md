# Rubot
This is a rubik's cube solver that I'm doing
Including:
- A color detector to scan and get the color of the cube using the webcam (in Python)
- A C program to control the robot (I'm using an Arduino Uno to run the robot)
Here is the demo of the Robot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcVvxii5C1M
Things need to be done:
- Finish the color detector (Output is all colors of the Rubik's cube)
- Connect it to a Solver (using kociemba source code)
- Finish a program can send the solution to robot through the Serial Port of the Arduino
