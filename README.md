# Rubot
This is a rubik's cube solver that I'm doing
Including:
- A color detector to scan and get the color of the cube using the webcam (in Python)
- A C program to control the robot (I'm using an Arduino Uno to run the robot)
- A solver (using Kociemba algorithm)
Here is the demo: https://youtu.be/1WTYGTRvSD8
